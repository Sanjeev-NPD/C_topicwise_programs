/*Polymorphism: It refers to the ability of a function, object, or method to take on many forms

Types of Polymorphism in C++
Polymorphism in C++ is broadly classified into two categories:

1. Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism: Resolved during compilation. Achieved through function and operator overloading.
    a. Function overloading
    b. operator overloading
2. Run-Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism : Resolved during runtime. Achieved through inheritance and virtual functions.
    a. virtual function
    b. Inheritence*/
