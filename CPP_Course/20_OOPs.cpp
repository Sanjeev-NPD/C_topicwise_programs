//////// Difference between PoP & OOPs programming: 
//////The primary difference between Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lies in how they structure and manage code. Here's a detailed comparison

// Key Differences

// Design Philosophy:
// POP is function-centric, while OOP is object-centric.

// Data and Functions:
// In POP, data and functions are separate, with functions operating on global data.
// In OOP, data and functions are encapsulated within objects.

// Modularity and Reusability:
// OOP offers better modularity and reusability due to its class-based structure.
// POP has limited modularity, making code harder to manage as it grows.

// Security:
// OOP provides better data security through encapsulation and data hiding.
// POP exposes data globally, leading to potential security issues.

// Complexity Management:
// OOP is better suited for managing complex and large-scale software projects.
// POP is simpler and may be more suitable for small-scale or straightforward tasks.

// When to Use :
// POP: Suitable for simple, linear problems and small-scale applications.
// OOP: Ideal for complex, scalable applications where data security, modularity, and reusability are important.
