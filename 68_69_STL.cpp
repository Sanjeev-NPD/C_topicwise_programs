/*The Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ is a powerful and flexible collection of classes and functions that provide many common data structures and algorithms. 
The STL is used for several reasons:
1. Efficiency and Performance
Optimized Implementation: STL components are highly optimized for performance. They are carefully crafted to offer the best possible performance in terms of both time and space complexity.
Generic Programming: The STL uses templates, allowing you to create data structures and algorithms that work with any data type, ensuring that your code is both efficient and flexible.

2.Code Reusability: Pre-written Data Structures and Algorithms || Avoiding Reinventing the new structure or function

3.Portability: Standardized Across Platforms: The STL is a standardized part of the C++ language, meaning that code written using STL will work consistently across different platforms and
  compilers. 

4.Flexibility : Interchangeable Components: The generic nature of the STL means that you can easily switch out data structures or algorithms without needing to change much of your code. 

5.Ease of Use:Simple Interface: The STL provides a simple and consistent interface for working with data structures and algorithms, which can significantly reduce the complexity of your code.
  Built-in Functionality: With the STL, many common tasks are made simple. For example, sorting a list of elements is as easy as calling std::sort.
  
  
Common Components of STL:

Containers: Data structures that store objects and data. Types: Sequence | Associative | Derived
Examples: std::vector, std::list, std::map, std::set

Algorithms: Functions to perform operations on containers.
Examples: std::sort, std::find, std::accumulate, std::binary_search

Iterators: Objects that point to elements in containers and allow traversal.
Examples: std::vector<int>::iterator, std::list<int>::const_iterator

Functors and Lambda Expressions: Objects and inline functions that can be used as custom operations in algorithms.
Examples: std::greater<int>, lambda functions in C++11 and later.
